> Welcome to training! The gateway to a promising career in tech. Here at Revature, we have 10-12 weeks of training to help you become industry ready by the time you interview with our clients.

I'm sure you want to hit the ground running and make the most of the experience. And so, for the eager associate hungry for success, I wrote this guide for you!

Once upon a time, I was also an associate. During my days as an associate, I've learned a couple of things that I'd like to share with you to help ease your training experience.

First, you'd want to think about your schedule. On a weekly basis, expect at least 1 written assessment and 1 QC session, on top of daily lectures and project work. Speaking of projects, you have project presentation approx every two weeks, depending on your trainer and the curriculuum.

## Weekly Assessments

There are 3 weekly assessments you should more or less be prepared for:

1. Written Assessment
   - Usually found in RevPro, your written assessment is a quiz type. Mostly made of multiple choice, true or false and the occasional choose all that apply questions. It usually is composed of 30 - 60 questions, the time given to answer the written assessment is variable to the number of questions in the quiz. Expect a written assessment on the same day as QC, usually Mondays.
2. Verbal Assessment
   - You will have weekly QC sessions which will be similar to a group interview. Treat it as such. QC is an assessment designed to simulate the interview experience. The weekly schedule and topics for QC will be announced Friday the week before or Monday of the next week at the latest.
3. Coding Assessment
   - Sometimes, instead of a Q & A style, QC will surprise you with a coding assessment. Don't worry! They usually give practice problems similar to the actual problem given in the QC session. Other than QC, coding assessments are pretty standard for a Friday morning exercise. The coding assessment is meant to help you practice your problem solving skills just in case you get a coding interview.

## Not so weekly but still very important assessments

Although these next set of assessments aren't a weekly occurence, they are still very important to concentrate on.

1. Project
   - Almost every two weeks, you'll get a project deadline. Project requirements are based on the content we'll go over prior to the project deadline. Start work early on your projects so you'll have enough time to debug and refine your work! Better to have something to debug than have nothing to present.
2. Hackathon
   - Depending on how timing in training goes, hackathons are fun team building activities where you can flex your creativity! Usually done over the course of two days with a presentation at the end.
3. Reporting
   - Another activity that's relative to training timing, reporting activities are usually done by group. Perfect for practicing research and soft skills. Usually reporting activities are announced one to two days before the actual presentation date.
4. Certification Exams
   - Sitting in for certs is an integral part of the pega currciuluum. Getting the CSA is important in getting placed with our clients. It's important that you study up on getting your CSA as soon as we hit Pega content.

## Assessment Prioritizaiton

I suggest you say goodbye to your loved ones for the next 10 weeks. (Just kidding). But there's a lot of assessments as you're learning. Most of them are there to help you practice what you're learning so it helps with your understanding. However, it is easy to get side tracked. In terms of prioritization of individual assessments here's a breakdown:

1. Project
2. Certification
3. QC
4. Written Assessments

Project work is at the top because it's important you gain experience in training that you can talk about during your interview. Certification is a close second because you need to be CSA to be able to interview with clients. QC is second when you're not in exam season because it's the assessment designed to simulate the interview experience. Use QC as a weekly opportunity to hone your interview skills. Finally, written assessments are at the end because while it's unlikely you'll get an entrance examination for your interview, you will need practice in test taking for the certification exams.

## Scheduling

Ten weeks in training is really tough. I have been there and done that. What's really important is creating a schedule and sticking to it. I highly suggest creating a work/study schedule that works with your personality type. However, just as a guideline, here's my general schedule when I was an associate:

**Monday - Thursday:**

    9:00 - 5:00 CST : Attend training. Work on project during break and free time.
    5:00 - 6:00 CST : Take a walk and destress after work
    6:00 - 6:30 CST: Review notes for the day from training
    6:30 - 8:00 CST: Prepare dinner, eat
    8:00 - 11:00 CST: Work on project

**Friday**:

    9:00 - 5:00 CST : Attend training. Work on project during break and free time.
    5:00 - 6:00 CST : Take a walk and destress after work
    6:00 - 6:30 CST: Review notes for the day from training
    Take rest of the evening off

**Weekends**

During the weekends, I like to keep my mornings and evenings free for errands and social obligations.

**Saturday:**

    Project work during the afternoon.

**Sunday:**

    Study for QC in the afternoon.
        Compile notes from training last week.
        Practice answering (out loud) why, what, how questions for each major topic in curricula.
    Work on project if there is time
